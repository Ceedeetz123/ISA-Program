<h2>Trn v80</h2>

<h3>Intro</h3>
<p>From a lot of requests I found myself ordering this earphone as it was pretty cheap and It reminds me of the DUNU Falcon-C as it 
has that same round shape of that earphone so maybe I’m here for a treat but who knows... </p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h4>Packaging</h4>
<p>When it comes to packaging it is pretty minimal and disappointing as it only contains a manual, 3 pairs of ear tips and a 2-pin cable but with that it is ok considering of the costs which is around £20. 
The cable is ok and is provides good enough to be a cable replacement. I like the ear tips as it has a smaller inner diameter in 3.8mm so it stays in the earphone</p>
 when I take out the earphone out of my ears.</p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h4>Build and Comfort</h4>
<p>I found the comfort to be amazing it fits the ear like a glove and it provides with a sufficient amount of isolation which is surprising to say at least. 
The build quality is good as it has a metal shell to protect the earphone but after a month of use the painting of the earphone is coming off and there are grey patches 
which I don’t mind as long it is still functioning it is ok..</p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h3>Sound</h3>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h4>Lows</h4>
<p>The lows are the highlight of the V80’s as the bass is really clean and not overpowering over the vocals which is my main criteria to see if an earphone has good lows. This may indicate that this earphone has more sub-bass than 
In the song toxicity the drums are impeccable as it does not interfere with the vocals and I could pinpoint in my head where the drums are located which shows that this earphone has really good imaging too. </p>

<p>Furthermore, this is not a good earphone for bass heads as it does not rumble that much compared to say a beats headphone which has its lows overpowering everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h4>Mids</h4>
<p>The mids are ok not much to talk about as it is defiantly the most back compared to the lows and highs, so it shows this is a V shaped earphone. 
There are some details in some vocals of female singers but other than that it fells like that it is lacking in a lot of detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="col">
<h4>Highs</h4>
<p>In the TRN V80’s it tries to inch any detail in the upper region which attracts a lot of sibilance and some cases pierce but in retain gains a lot of airiness to it which I like but the pierce can be too much sometimes depending on the song so anyone who is really picky w
hen it comes to highs ignore this earphone.</p>
</div>

<div class="col">
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>This Is kind of a steal for earphone that costs around £20, the bass of the V80’s are impeccable but with that it has an ok mids and a detailed but piercing and sibilant high.  
The soundstage is sufficient, and imaging is really good especially in drums. This is a steal for drummers who have a strict budget and also for anyone who are treble heads. </p>
